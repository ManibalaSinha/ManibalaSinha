# Hi, I'm Manibala 

I’m a Full Stack Developer with strong experience building scalable web applications using Node.js, Python + Automation AI work flow, Angular, and React. Over the years, I’ve worked across both frontend and backend development, designing APIs, integrating databases, and delivering end-to-end features for enterprise and startup projects.

I enjoy solving complex problems, improving performance, and writing clean, testable code. Whether it’s building RESTful services in Java/Python, developing interactive UIs in Angular/React, or working with SQL/NoSQL databases, I adapt quickly to project needs and deliver results.

Core Skills:
• Node.js | Python | JavaScript | TypeScript
• Angular | React | HTML | CSS
• REST APIs | Microservices | Spring Boot | Node.js
• SQL | PostgreSQL | MongoDB
• Git | Agile | CI/CD

I’m actively looking for Full Stack, Backend, or Frontend developer roles (remote or onsite) where I can contribute immediately and grow with a strong engineering team.
